# PyDOS
This is my version of MS-DOS in Python. I am not the best programmer ever, so this is pretty bad. Also it is open source but i still want credit :)


# -------*HOW TO SETUP!*-------

1. Download Visual Studio Code or any other IDE
2. Open the .py file in the IDE
3. Build and Test it. Have fun!
